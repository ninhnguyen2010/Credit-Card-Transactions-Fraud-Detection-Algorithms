# Credit-Card-Transactions-Fraud-Detection-Algorithms

In this project, we present a fraud detection algorithm built by a dataset of 100,000 credit card transactions in 2010. We will perform data cleaning, variable creation, feature selection, and preliminary model exploration. In the end, we will choose a final model and suggest a recommended cut-off that optimizes cost savings.
